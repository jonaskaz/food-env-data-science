## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import data}
path <- "data/DataDownload.xls"
df_all <- path %>%
  excel_sheets() %>%
  set_names() %>%
  map(read_excel, path = path)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r EDA}
glimpse(df_all[9])
df_access <- df_all[[5]]
df_stores <- df_all[[6]]
df_restaurants <- df_all[[7]]
df_assistance <- df_all[[8]]
df_insecurity <- df_all[[9]]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


PCT_SNAP16
"SNAP participants (% pop), 2016*"

PCT_SNAP12
"SNAP participants (% pop), 2012*"

VLFOODSEC_13_15
"Household very low food security (%, three-year average), 2013-15*"

```{r}
df_assist_insec <-
  inner_join(
    df_assistance,
    df_insecurity,
    by = c("FIPS", "State", "County")
  )


```


```{r}
glimpse(df_assist_insec)
```

```{r}
df_assist_insec %>%
  ggplot(aes(PCT_SNAP12, VLFOODSEC_13_15)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

```{r}
df_assist_insec %>%
  ggplot(aes(PCT_SNAP12, VLFOODSEC_13_15)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = State))

```
